# Mask-Detector
it a a project on mask detection using python and machine learning
Sure! Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started with the face mask detection project:

Step 1: Set up the Environment
- Install Python: Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website (python.org) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

Step 2: Create a Project Directory
- Create a new directory for your project. You can choose a suitable name for the directory.

Step 3: Install Required Packages
- Create a virtual environment (optional): It's a good practice to create a virtual environment to isolate the project's dependencies. Navigate to your project directory in the command prompt or terminal and run the following command:
```
python -m venv venv
```
- Activate the virtual environment (optional): Activate the virtual environment using the appropriate command based on your operating system:
For Windows:
```
venv\Scripts\activate
```
For macOS and Linux:
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
- Create a requirements.txt file: In your project directory, create a file named `requirements.txt`. Open the file and add the following packages to it:
```
datetime
winsound
opencv-python
numpy
tensorflow
```
- Install the packages: Run the following command to install the required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Step 4: Prepare the Models and Resources
- Download face detection model: Download the Haar Cascade classifier XML file named `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` from the OpenCV GitHub repository and save it in your project directory.
- Download mask detection model: If you don't have a trained mask detection model, you can search for pre-trained models online or train your own using a dataset. Once you have a trained model, save it as `mask_detection_model.h5` in your project directory.

Step 5: Write the Code
- Create a Python file: Create a new Python file in your project directory. You can choose a suitable name for the file, such as `mask_detection.py`.
- Copy and paste the code provided earlier into the Python file.

Step 6: Run the Program
- Open a command prompt or terminal.
- Navigate to your project directory.
- Activate the virtual environment if you created one (optional).
- Run the program by executing the following command:
```
python mask_detection.py
```
- The program will open the video feed from your webcam and perform real-time face mask detection. It will display bounding boxes around detected faces and labels indicating whether a mask is present or not. If a person is not wearing a mask, a beep sound will play.

Congratulations! You have now successfully set up and run the face mask detection project. You can further customize and enhance the code as per your requirements.
